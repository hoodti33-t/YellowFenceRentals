<h3>Locking Safety Systems</h3>

<p>The clamps make it frustratingly difficult for unwelcome visitors to access your job site.</p>
<br>
<br>

<ul>
  <li>
Control debris
</li>
<li>
Add privacy to your site
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Patented Reflective Stripping</h3>
<p>Night construction and job sites that are located in busy locations need extra</p><p> visibility – so we have added reflective strips along our fence panels to ensure your site is highly visible.</p>
<br>
<h3>High-Visibility Paint</h3>
<p>The paint we use is vibrant and easy to see.</p>
<p>It’s another way we ensure your worksite is safely noticeable.</p>
<br>

<h4>Safety & Specialty Bases</h4>
We have 2 different bases to choose from:
<br>
<br>
<h3>Specialty:</h3> these bases are meant for highway dividers. They don’t bulge out and pose a danger to passing vehicles<br>
 – they are nicely tucked in and keep your fence perfectly secure.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Safety:</h3> these bases are for any worksites that aren’t on the highway. They have a ‘Donald Duck’s Beak’ (c’mon, it’s a perfect analogy) that slides up the fence base.
<br> It helps reduce the risk of tripping.
<br>
<br>
Both base types can be placed on earth, wood, and concrete surfaces.
